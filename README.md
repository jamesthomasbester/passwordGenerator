the application takes in a few requirement variables and generates a password based on the variables.

the requirements are appended to the end of the string. so there will only be one of each of the requested variables,
hopefully in the future i will update this, so the user can alter the requirements even further. 

any questions can be dirrected to jamesthomasbester@gmail.com

thanks :)
